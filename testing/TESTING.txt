Purpose: Hold information regarding the Testing aspect of the PicnicTable Database
-----------------

Testing Each of the 7 Functions in DB.c

1. importDB()
    - implementation of the Database from a .csv file is tested by comparing printing statements of Lookup Tables to expected output of the Lookup Tables, and comparing printing statements of the Picnic Table Linked List to the expected outputs
    - the expected outputs of the lookup tables and main PicnicTable database are found in importDBOutput.txt
    - input: PicnicTableSmall.csv
    - output: importDBOutput.txt
    - diff command is ran on the printing output of importDB() and importDBOutput.txt

2. exportDB()
    - testing exportDB() will be tested by running a diff command on the function's output file and PicnicTableSmall.csv

3. countEntries()
    -prints the expected return value as integer "count"
    -tests function calls on all members specified in DB.h
    -all function calls in this section are what I used while developing the function

4. sortByMember()
    -

5. compressDB()
6. unCompressDB()
7. freeDB()
